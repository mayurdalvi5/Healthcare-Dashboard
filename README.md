# Healthcare Dashboard Project

This project is a comprehensive **Healthcare Dashboard** designed to monitor key healthcare performance indicators (KPIs) dynamically and interactively. The dashboard provides real-time insights into patient statistics and healthcare performance, helping healthcare professionals increase overall hospital efficiency and patient satisfaction.

## About the Use Case

The **Healthcare Dashboard** enables users to:
- Monitor various KPIs like the number of patients, inpatients/outpatients stays, cost weights, and lengths of stay.
- Analyze healthcare data across different stay types, facilities, and specializations.
- Identify trends in costs, patient volumes, and resource utilization over time.

This dashboard can be used in a hospital setting to gain valuable insights into patient metrics, helping optimize operations, reduce costs, and improve patient care outcomes.

## About the Dataset

The data used in this project is derived from various healthcare sources, including:
- Medical records
- Financial data
- Statistical measurements
- Population demographics
- Insurance data

These datasets are critical in understanding health disparities, monitoring hospital performance, and addressing health inequities in patient populations.

## Dashboard Components

### 1. Homepage
The homepage offers a quick overview of key healthcare statistics:
- **Number of Patients:** Displays total patient count.
- **InPatients Stay & OutPatients Stay:** Shows detailed counts of inpatient and outpatient visits.
- **Total Cost Weight:** Total cost associated with patient care.
- **Cost Weight per Stay:** Average cost for each stay type.
- **Length of Stay & Stay Per Patient:** Provides information on the duration and frequency of patient stays.

### 2. Summary Analysis
The summary analysis page gives a more in-depth analysis of the following:
- **Total Cost Weight by Year:** Breakdown of costs per stay type and facility.
- **Number of Patients by Stay Type:** Comparison between inpatient and outpatient numbers.
- **Cost per Stay by Facility and Specialty:** Displays financial metrics across different facilities and medical specializations.
- **Patients by Facility and Stay Type:** Visualizes patient distribution across hospitals and stay types.

## KPIs

The key performance indicators (KPIs) tracked in this project include:
- Number of Patients
- Total Cost Weight
- Cost per Stay
- Length of Stay
- Stay per Patient
- Distribution of Patients by Stay Type and Facility

## Dashboard File

The **Healthcare Dashboard** is implemented in Power BI and is available in the file `Healthcare Dashboard.pbix`. You can use this file to explore the different views, apply filters, and customize reports based on your requirements.
